Graph Vocabulary
  - Vertex: Each vertex represents a piece of data in the graph
  - Edge: Nodes and Vertices are connected by edges
  - Weighted: Weighted graphs have values placed on each edge, this is the cost to travel from one node to another
  - Directed Graphs: In a directed graph, edges can be unidirectional or bidirectional.
  - Undirected Graphs: Every edges is bidirectional
  - Acyclic: Where you can never traverse from a single node back to itself.
